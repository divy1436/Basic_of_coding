# My Coding Journey & Projects  

Welcome to my personal coding repository! This repository serves as a centralized place for my coding exercises, learning materials, and various projects across different programming languages and computer science concepts.

## Repository Structure  

The repository is organized to facilitate easy navigation through different programming languages and topics. Here's a brief overview of the main directories:

* **`.vscode/`**: Contains VS Code specific settings and configurations.
* **`c/`**: C programming language exercises and projects.
* **`c++/`**: C++ programming language exercises and projects.
* **`dsa/`**: Dedicated section for Data Structures and Algorithms implementations and practice problems, potentially across multiple languages.
* **`HTML/`**: HTML-related learning, exercises, and small web projects.
* **`java/`**: Comprehensive Java learning materials and projects, including:
    * **`chapter1/`**: Code and notes from Chapter 1 of a Java learning resource.
    * **`chapter2/`**: Code and notes from Chapter 2 of a Java learning resource.
    * **`crt_question/`**: Solutions or attempts for CRT (Campus Recruitment Training) questions in Java.
    * **`dsa/`**: Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in Java.
    * **`oops/`**: Object-Oriented Programming concepts and examples in Java.
    * **`practice_q.../`**: Various Java practice questions and their solutions.
* **`oops/`**: General Object-Oriented Programming concepts and examples, possibly language-agnostic or for languages other than Java.
* **`python/`**: Python programming language exercises, scripts, and projects.
* **`rental/`**: A specific project, likely a "rental" application or system.
